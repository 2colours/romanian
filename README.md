# The Romanian Language / Românește

## Foreword

Having struggled to find a list of useful resources to learn the Romanian language and having been inspired by a fellow language learner, [TheDomcio],(https://github.com/TheDomcio) and his [wonderful repository for the Polish language](https://github.com/TheDomcio/WonderfulPolishLanguage), I decided to create a repository dedicated to the Romanian language.

I invite everybody and anybody to contribute to his and my own repository, and to create one for other languages which do not yet have such a repository.
